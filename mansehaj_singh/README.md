# Object Detection & Tracking with YOLOv8  
**Author:** Mansehaj Singh  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements **object detection and tracking** using the pretrained YOLOv8 model (Ultralytics).  
The model is fine-tuned on a custom dataset containing two classes:  

- `person`  
- `car`  

The pipeline covers:
- Dataset preparation (train/val/test split + annotations in YOLO format)  
- Model training with YOLOv8  
- Evaluation on validation/test sets  
- Demo inference on custom videos/images
